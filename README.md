#Emoji
Emoji is RESTful API for CRUD operations on the common emojis reimagined
for Nigerians. The API uses simple token based authentication


#Testing
 The phpspec suite for testing is used to perform
 unit test on the classes. The TDD principle has been
 employed to make the application robust

 Run this on bash to execute the tests
 ```````bash
 vendor/bin/phpspec run --format=pretty
`````````

#usage
The documentation of this API is found at [the official website](https://naijaemoji.herokuapp.com). Please refer
